# Music_Recommended
Denning, Cooper
Anderson, Zane
Using Pitchfork Reviews and user feedback to give album

recommendations.

This project was derived from a dataset found on kaggle.com. The hopes of the project is to build
an AI that gives you good music recommendations. It will use a system of Boolean likes and
dislikes so that the AI will in turn offer recommendation based on this information. Finding
music that someone might be interested is very important and an AI that does this well might be
very lucrative when it comes to steaming platforms like Spotify and Tidal. The heuristics for the
system are the like and dislike option but it might also be important to start with a preferred
genre to narrow down the window. An important algorithm to put in might be one that compares
each album in the dataset to the liked/disliked albums so that the system can learn what about the
albums the listener preferred and will make recommendations on a deeper level than just genre.
We hope to make something that we will want to use to find new music. It is apparent that a nice
GUI will be required so that using it is not a hassle. I think a point system that rewards albums
with points when their criteria matches the liked album and then returning the 3 highest point
valued albums will be the best way to go about it.
